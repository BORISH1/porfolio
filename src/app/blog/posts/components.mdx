When documenting my projects (like my Job Platform app built with **Next.js + PostgreSQL + Supabase**), I often need more than plain text.  
That’s why I started using **custom components in MDX** — they help me write richer blog posts with **tables, code snippets, cards, accordions**, and more.  

## Feedback Blocks

I use feedback blocks to **highlight important notes** in my posts, like when explaining PostgreSQL queries or API caveats.

```tsx
<Feedback
    icon
    variant="success"
    title="Database Connected!"
    description="PostgreSQL connection was successful and migrations are running."
/>
