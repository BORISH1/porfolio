## Project Journey

I’m working on a job platform project where skilled individuals (like plumbers, carpenters, tutors, and freelancers) can connect with people looking for their services.  
This is one of my main projects during my Computer Science Engineering studies.

## Tech Stack

The backend and database are managed with **PostgreSQL** (I even wrote custom SQL functions for insert, update, delete, and reporting).  
For the frontend, I’m building with **Next.js** and **React**, while using **Supabase** to simplify authentication and database integration.  

## Example Metadata

Here’s an example of how I keep project details structured in my blog posts:
