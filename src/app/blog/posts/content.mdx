## Avatar

Replace the `public/images/avatar.jpg` file with my own profile picture.  
It will appear on the `/about` page and in the dynamically generated open-graph images.

## Favicon

Replace the `src/app/favicon.ico` file with my own favicon.

## Content

Update the `resources/content.js` file with my own details.  
I can also use custom components, but I need to import them before using.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="1-2"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`import { InlineCode } from "@once-ui-system/core";
import Link from "next/link";

const person = {
  ...
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Personal details

My personal details are displayed across the app (headings, labels, images).  
Languages are shown on `/about`, and location/time in the header.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2-3,7-10"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const person = {
    firstName: "Borish",
    lastName: "Ningombam",
    get name() {
      return "Borish Ningombam";
    },
    role: "Computer Science Student & Developer",
    avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    location: "Asia/Kolkata", 
    languages: ["English", "Hindi", "Manipuri"],
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Social links

My social links will appear on `/about` and in the footer.  
I can add any I want (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email, etc.).

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const social = [
    {
      name: "GitHub",
      icon: "github",
      link: "https://github.com/borish-ningombam",
    },
    {
      name: "LinkedIn",
      icon: "linkedin",
      link: "https://linkedin.com/in/borish-ningombam",
    },
    {
      name: "Email",
      icon: "email",
      link: "mailto:borish@example.com",
    },
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Pages

Each page has its own object that manages headings, descriptions, and dynamic data.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const home = {
    label: "Home",
    title: "Borish Ningombam's Portfolio",
    description: "Portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and journey as a Computer Science student and developer.",
    headline: <>Aspiring Computer Scientist & Problem Solver</>,
    subline: (
      <>
        I'm Borish, a CSE student preparing for GATE and building full-stack projects.
        <br /> I love solving problems, exploring new tech, and sharing my journey.
      </>
    ),
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />
