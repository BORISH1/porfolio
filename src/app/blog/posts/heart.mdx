## Overview

This piece captures the emotions of heartbreak — the silence after love fades, the heaviness of memories, and the slow journey of healing. It is written not as a technical project, but as a project of the heart: documenting the process of breaking, bending, and slowly finding light again.

## Key Feelings

- **Silence That Hurts**: Discovering how quiet moments feel heavier than noise, echoing with absence.  
- **Memories as Mirrors**: Every memory reflects both the beauty of love and the pain of loss.  
- **Scars into Stories**: Recognizing that wounds may one day transform into lessons and strength.  
- **Hope Beyond Hurt**: Even in pain, there remains a quiet belief that healing is possible.  

## Lessons Learned

Heartbreak teaches patience. It reveals how strong yet fragile we can be, and how emotions carve deep truths into us.  
It shows that love is not just joy, but also risk — and that surviving loss is itself an act of courage.  

## Outcome

Though the heart feels shattered, the journey continues. The scars are proof of love once lived.  
And while the missing piece remains, there is hope that light will return, slowly, one heartbeat at a time.
