## Overview

I developed a flexible and highly customizable design system using Next.js for the front-end and Figma for collaborative design work.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.  
- **Theming and Customization**: Implemented a theming system with CSS variables and design tokens for customizable color palettes, typography, and layouts.  
- **Figma Collaboration**: Created and maintained a shared Figma design library that was synchronized with the codebase to keep design tokens consistent across platforms.  
- **Documentation**: Documented the system with Storybook, providing component demos, usage guidelines, and best practices for easy adoption.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – For building fast, scalable React applications.  
- **Figma** – For managing design assets and prototypes.  
- **Styled-Components** – For themable, modular CSS-in-JS styling.  
- **Storybook** – For interactive documentation of components.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was balancing flexibility with consistency. I addressed this by defining clear design tokens and guidelines for customization. I also improved collaboration workflows between design and development using Git and Figma, which streamlined the process significantly.

## Outcome

This design system is now used across my projects, resulting in faster development, consistent UI patterns, and smoother collaboration. It has become the foundation for building scalable, user-friendly applications with a cohesive design language.
